            <h3>Tips/Tricks/Advice</h3>
            <p>Use crockpots to keep your hot foods hot. That way you can keep the food close to hand and not have to keep running to the kitchen. They’re pretty easy to pick up at thrift stores.</p>
            <p>Wrap your meats in aluminum foil. This makes it easy to heat them in a crockpot, and easy to hand out to your fellowship. </p>
            <p>Use #10 cans and ice packs as personal mini coolers to keep your drinks cold.</p>
            <p>Keep your portions small, there’s a lot of food to be eaten.</p>
            <p>The fish stew that Eowyn makes in the needs to be vile. You don’t have to eat it even. Channel your inner Gimli, “No, I couldn’t, I just couldn’t”. Our recipe for it is a can of undrained tuna fish, water, chopped celery, and random seasonings. It’s never the same twice.</p>
            <h3>Common Food Substitutions</h3>
            <p>Ale – Root Beer/soda</p>
            <p>Wine – Grape Juice</p>
            <p>Tea – Coffee/Hot Chocolate</p>
            <p>Pork – Beef/Turkey/Chicken</p>
            <p>Sushi – Cooked fish/Swedish fish</p>
