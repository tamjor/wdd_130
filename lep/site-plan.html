        The Lord of the Rings movies are an epic journey we love to watch. What better way to immerse 
        yourself into the epic saga than to join the characters in their meals and snacks, just as we 
        would with friends and family. Have some cake when Bilbo’s birthday cake makes an appearance. 
        Have an apple. How many pieces of lembas will you eat? 
        
        Explain that modification is key, feel free to adjust to their own situations and circumstances. 
        My family doesn’t like mushrooms or tomatoes, so we find alternatives, etc.… 
        
        There are times when characters are shown holding a bowl of something, so we decide if we want 
        to add stew or hot chocolate for that moment; typically, it’s hot chocolate earlier in the day, 
        and stew later in the day. Can’t always tell what they’re drinking either, so we decided if it 
        was in a mug we’d do a hot drink, a tankard means some root beer, and a goblet sparkling grape 
        juice, unless it's otherwise specified.
        
        It does take time. Preparation is key.
