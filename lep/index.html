                    </div>
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings movies are an epic journey we love to watch! Spending time with the 
                    members of the Fellowship in a movie marathon is a fantastic way to spend the day! Take your enjoyment to 
                    new levels by feasting your way through the movies with them and immerse yourself into the epic saga! 
                    Join the characters during their meals and snacks. Enjoy the foods shown and talked about 
                    on screen. Have some cake at Bilbo’s birthday party. Munch on an apple 
                    with Merry. How many pieces of lembas bread will you eat? My family and I have been enjoying
                    this long expected party for years and would love to invite you to join us.

                    <p> Experience has taught us that keeping track of all the food can be a challenge. 
                        We've put together this site to help you navigate your party depending on whether
                        you're watching the theatrical or extended version of the movies. Using our guides 
                        you'll be able to keep track of what and when to eat. Included are time stamps,  
                        descriptions of the scenes, and various tips and tricks we've discovered to help you
                        make your very own long expected party a success!

                    <p>Sometimes you might have a Gollum in your fellowship who just can't eat lembas, so modify!
                    Modification is key to a successful party. Feel free to adjust to your own situations 
                    and circumstances. Whatever your own personal dietary needs or preferences, 
                    just change it or skip it altogether. This is supposed to be fun!<br>
                    There are some foods that wouldn’t be good for us to eat (Orc, worm, raw rabbit...  
                    you get the idea) and some that just don’t exist (lembas, orc draught, ent draught). 
                    For these foods you get to come up with your own alternatives; pick your favorites and enjoy!</p>
