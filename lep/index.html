                    <h3>Join the Fun!</h3>  
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings movies are an epic journey we love to watch. Immerse yourself 
                    into the epic saga than to join the characters in their meals and snacks. Eat when they eat.
                    Have some cake when Bilbo’s birthday cake makes an appearance. Have an apple. How many 
                    pieces of lembas bread will you eat? Use my guide to know what to eat and when to supplement
                    your movie experience! </p> 
                    <p>My family and I have been doing this for years and keeping track of all the food 
                    can be a challenge. In this site you will be able to find lists of what and when 
                    to eat depending on if you’re watching the theatrical release movies or the 
                    extended-release movies</p>

                    <h3>Modify, modify, modify</h3>
                    <p>Modification is key. Feel free to adjust to your own situations and circumstances. 
                    Don’t drink? Just sub in your favorite soda. A member of my family is allergic to 
                    pork, and turkey bacon is just nasty (my own personal opinion, if you like it, go 
                    you!) so we do beef jerky. Whatever your own personal dietary needs or preferences, 
                    just change it or skip it altogether. This is supposed to be fun!</p>
                    <p>There are some foods that wouldn’t be so good for us to eat (Orc, worm, raw rabbit...  
                    You get the idea.) and some that just don’t exist (lembas, orc draught, ent draught). 
                    For these foods you get to come up with your own alternatives; pick your favorites!</p>

                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <p>Preparation is key. It does take time. I recommend that you do your baking a couple 
                    of days before, cook your meats the day before, and start your stew that morning if 
                    you’re making it from scratch. The idea is to make it so you can so you can relax and 
                    enjoy the movies!</p>
                    <p>You'll want to designate a food staging areas where you can quickly grab your foods. 
                    We typically break the foods down into cold, hot, and room temp. Room temp foods get put
                    out on a table, hot foods get stored in a crockpot, and cold get stored in a cooler</p>
