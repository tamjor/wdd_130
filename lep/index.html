                    <h3>Join the Fun!</h3>  
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings movies are an epic journey we love to watch. What better way
                    to immerse yourself into the epic saga than to join the characters in their meals 
                    and snacks, just as we would with friends and family. Have some cake when Bilbo’s 
                    birthday cake makes an appearance. Have an apple. How many pieces of lembas bread 
                    will you eat?</p> 
                    <p>My family and I have been doing this for years and keeping track of all the food 
                    can be a challenge. In this site you will be able to find lists of what and when 
                    to eat depending on if you’re watching the theatrical release movies or the 
                    extended-release movies</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Modify, modify, modify</h3>
                    <p>Modification is key. Feel free to adjust to your own situations and circumstances. 
                    Don’t drink? Just sub in your favorite soda. A member of my family is allergic to 
                    pork, and turkey bacon is just nasty (my own personal opinion, if you like it, go 
                    you!) so we do beef jerky. Whatever your own personal dietary needs or preferences, 
                    just change it or skip it altogether. This is supposed to be fun!</p>
                    <p>There are some foods that wouldn’t be so good for us to eat (Orc, worm, raw rabbit. 
                    You get the idea.) and some that don’t exist (lembas, orc draught, ent draught). 
                    For these foods you get to come up with your own alternatives.</p>
                    <p>There are times when characters are shown holding a bowl or cup of something and 
                    there’s just no way to determine what it actually is, so we guess, and that’s what 
                    will be shown in the list of foods. Typically, if it’s a bowl we’ll do stew, if 
                    it’s a mug, depending on the scene, either ale or tea.</p>

                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <p>Preparation is key. It does take time. The extended release movies have a runtime 
                    of eleven hours! There’s no healthy way you can do all the cooking the same day. 
                    I recommend that you do your baking a couple of days before, cook your meats the 
                    day before, and start your stew that morning if you’re making it from scratch. </p>
