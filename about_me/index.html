    <h2>Tamara</h2>
    <p style="width:1000px">Hello! I live in Idaho, but grew up in Wyoming, Washington, and Nevada. I did camping, hunting, and 
         fishing growing up. I met my husband 24 years ago and we have been married for over 23 years now. I am a stay at home 
         mom with 4 children. The oldest two are out of the house (one married) and the youngest two are in high school (senior 
         and freshman). I like to read (mostly fantasy) and watch TV/movies (mostly nerdy/geeky) in my spare time, unless I get
         sucked into Facebook.</p>
    <p style="width:1000px">I am pursuing a BS in Applied Technology. I'm not quite sure yet what I'm going to do with it when I get it, but I'll    
         figure it out. If I don't know what I'm going to do with it, why am I going for it? I need something I'll be able to 
         do from home due to health issues. I am brand new to web design, never looked at html before in my life, and know next
         to nothing. 
    <p style="width:1000px">I grew up in the church and have a strong testimony of my Savior. I look forward to conference and hearing from the Prophet. 
        I am so grateful that the Church started Pathway Worldwide. I just completed it in July and am looking forward to learning
        more and developing my talents.</p>
